This is my sister's nutrition website, which I am creating for her. I am not doing much on it now, because she will be too
busy to tell me what to do until her Thanksgiving break.

I have 4 branches: a Node.js development and production branch and an ASP.NET MVC development and production branch. Whichever development environment I decide to work with, I will probably cut the other 2 branches at that point.
